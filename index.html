                    <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">All nuts are known to contain a lot of fat and calories.
                </h1>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">This is complete myth because nuts do contain a lot of calories and fats
                    . However, that does not means you should
                    exclude nuts from your diet.</p><br>

                <p>According to Professor Rune Blomhoff and his team of scientists from the University of Oslo in Norway
                    , consuming a
                    handful of nuts is proven to help maintain a controlled weight and also helps towards lowering bad
                    cholesterol.</p><br>

                <p>So now you can know that nuts are NOT fattening providing you don't overindulge and stick to the
                    recommended daily
                    protein of 30 g.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    It is important to mention though ,that not all nuts are equal . So let me tell you most optional
                    nuts from a health and
                    weight management perspective. The top three you should opt for are-

                </p><br>
                <p>1)Almonds <br>
                    2)Peanuts</p>
